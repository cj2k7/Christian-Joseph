## ðŸ“• Latest Projects

- [NBA Prediction Model](https://github.com/cj2k7/Christian-Joseph/blob/main/NBA%20Prediction.ipynb): This project was completed in Python, and the goal was to be able to predict future NBA games usoing past data on games. To complete this, I used a neural netowrk model on a dataset consisting of team data of each NBA team dating back to the 2011 season. The model was able to predict NBA games with 70 percent accuracy.  
- [Movie Recommender Engine](https://github.com/cj2k7/Christian-Joseph/blob/main/Movie%20Recommender.ipynb): This project was completed in Python, and was completed using a TF-IDF vecotrization, along with using cosine similarity to measure the correlation between two different movies. These techniques are then used to create a final similarity score, which is then ranked from highest to lowest, so when the user inputs a movie, the algorithm reutrns the five most similar movies.
- [Real Estate Price Prediction Model](https://github.com/cj2k7/Christian-Joseph/blob/main/Real%20Estate.ipynb): In this project, I used a dataset of house features and locations to predict the price of the given house in Python. I used polynomial feature transformation to develop more intricate relationships between variables, and then used linear regression, gradient boosted and random forest models to predict the housing prices. To assess the accuracy of all three models, I used MAPE(Mean Average Percent Error), MSE(Mean Squared Error), and R squared metrics. The best model was the random forest model, with an MAPE score of 1.82.
